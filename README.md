# App description
## App functionality:
This is my firs React APP. The calculator :) \
Main class component is src/pages/calculator.js (this component contains all of the logic).\
I also make some effort to style the calculator buttons and “display” with smoothly rounded corners (similar to squircle corners) (/src/pages/calculator.scss)
## Technologies used in project:
React, SASS
## How to run the code:
* Download the code and instal dependencies (in the project directory run: `npm install`)
* Run the app in the development mode (In the project directory run: `npm start`, then open http://localhost:3000 in the browser)
